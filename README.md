# oscd-extensions
Here we are collecting all extension namespaces to the IEC 61850-6 used agreed within and used by the OpenSCD ecosystem

If you have identified a need for an extension namespace that in your opinion is of use for the OpenSCD ecosystem and not for your individual project feel free to open a PR with a XSD file defining the namespace. 

> Please make sure to check existing namespaces before handing in a new one. We generally want to avoid conflicting namespaces here. If an existing namespace is somewhat but not fully serving your purpose hand in change request to the existing one first.

> Please be aware that adding a new namespace here is something we check very carefully so this might take some time. The review process is something we take carefully and we might have change request along the way.

> Please also be aware that your proposal could very well be rejected.
